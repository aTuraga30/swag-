Diana, an employee from the first organization, outlines their initial goal of using the metaverse to introduce a new brand and engage their 140,000 employees. They aim to roll out this platform by mid to late April and eventually adapt it for onboarding new hires.\n\nRepresentatives from the second organization, Gametronics, describe their expertise in building metaverses and provide examples of their work with companies like Microsoft, BMW, and Volvo. They elaborate on their platform, PartyNight, which caters to millions and supports a wide range of devices. The platform is capable of handling large-scale events and creating realistic, immersive experiences.\n\nThe discussion includes logistical and technical aspects, such as:\n- The scalability of their platform to handle large numbers of users.\n- Different levels of visual fidelity and how they can cater to various employee demographics.\n- Potential content formats and the integration of live and pre-recorded materials.\n- The importance of ensuring a seamless and secure experience within their existing tech landscape.\n\nThe conversation also touches on cultural sensitivities, ensuring the metaverse does not veer towards being overly game-like, which could be off-putting for certain office cultures. Diana, Paula, and their colleagues express their appreciation and outline next steps, which include sending a detailed brief and receiving feasibility confirmations and pricing from Gametronics.",
  "transcript": "entity. Not in all respects but in most respects we are trying to begin operating as one from that state. I look after employee engagement and transformation and in the pump for this organization and in essence what we are looking to do is bring a metaverse experience to our employees, all 140,000 of them as part of introducing the new brand and connecting them to it and engaging them around who we are as an organization. Less about the brand and more about the organization and why you should want to stay and why this is great for the future for our clients, for our people, for our partners and so on. So that's what we're looking to do and we have full disclosure we have already started talking to another partner who is new to us similarly to your organization that could potentially do something similar for us. We do have a very detailed brief that we can send to you afterwards that it describes everything that I've just summarized in two minutes that gives you a sense of what we're trying to do. The timelines that we work to is the end of April, so mid to end of April is when we'd like to introduce this as a way of engaging our people and then longer term Akhilesh who is who is heading up talent acquisition in the organization is also looking for a solution that we could use for onboarding. So we were thinking that if we design this as the initial employee experience and incorporate all of our great content into that it can easily then be used and evolve or be tweaked depending on what is required to be an onboarding platform for all new hires. That's it, that's my summary, very short and sweet. Renee and Paula, I don't know if there's anything that we need to add that I haven't said. No, that's it. I think that was good, thanks Diana. Okay, great. So Brian Johnson, Shilpam, over to you. Awesome. So yeah, Shilpam, may I? Sure, sure Azam. Okay, cool. Yeah, so thanks Diana, thanks for that elaborated, you know, it was enough for us to understand what you're looking for, so thank you and that was definitely insightful and that's something what we have done so I can, you know, and I'm pretty sure Shilpam and I both could actually connect with what you've been talking about. So great, so we are Gametronics, as you already know, we are about, you know, 2,000 people company based in multiple parts of the world and we have our own Metaverse called Party Night, which is right now catering to close to 700 plus brands, including some of the marketing brands like LVMH, BMW, Boeing very recently, you know, and then the entire Dubai Gold Souk, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and all these, you know, they have their presence and, you know, all have their presence in some or the other manner on our platform. So it's a platform play for us, it's a, so it becomes very, you know, scalable for us, so we built the entire tech which runs the Metaverse for us. Some of the things what you've already seen like Microsoft and other things were done in like absolutely no time, largely because consider us more like Roblox, but, you know, more towards realism than, you know, these blocky art and design, you know, that's a choice people make, so that's what we have done. So other than that, we work with a lot of governments, you know, we are part of Neom, which is the Dubai's, you know, flagship project right now in the MENA region, so we are working on Neom, we are working with seven different states in India and so PartyNight is built on a blockchain, it uses Unreal game engine technology, it works across all the platform, you know, it works on web, it works on mobile, PC, VR, non-VR and all those things. The Microsoft use case is absolutely, you know, what you're looking for because when we did Microsoft, their focus was not, you know, to talk about the products or something, it was more about what Microsoft brand stands for, what is their, you know, the vision what is there, you know, okay, so there was some recording and transcription thing, so yeah. So, okay, so and what Microsoft is a brand, what are... But Jeff, I'm so sorry, I don't mean to interrupt you, I've just realized that this meeting was not recording and we would like to record it... Oh yeah, sure, sure, absolutely. ...if you are not able to join. Absolutely not. Can I make you more comfortable with that, first of all? No, no, no, please go ahead, record it, it's just that the pop-up was like, you know, literally flashing. It is recording now. Yes, I know, I just got rid of the transcription, it's recording now. Please continue, I'm so sorry to interrupt. No, no, no worries, so yeah, so it was more about the core values of Microsoft, you know, the vision of Microsoft and some of the very subtle messages, like what they actually wanted to, you know, let their partner... It was built initially only for the Microsoft partners, but later it was launched during the Microsoft Productivity Conclave, which happens, their annual flagship event where they, you know, took it all around and, you know, it's part of pretty much every Microsoft office now, there is a kiosk, touchscreen kiosk, where people come and try different things and stuff. So we created the digital twin of the Redmond office where, and of course, you know, of the general manager of that, we created the avatar, custom avatar, and the scalability of the platform is proven with the fact that it actually worked on the Lumia phone, you know, the Microsoft Lumia phone, which is like a very, very obsolete architecture and the, you know, very low on hardware, this thing, but at the same time, we have technology that it can actually work on absolutely finest machines. It decides on whatever platform, your target platform, and it actually scales accordingly. So some of the subtle messages were like, you know, when you're sitting and waiting to meet the general manager of Microsoft, you know, do you, are you, are you, you know, inclined to know more about the brand, do you actually check out what are the magazines and stuff, what are kept over there? And do you try and understand and get deeper into this or you just talk about business and nothing else? And then certain other things where there are a lot of posters, and finally, the general manager actually walks with you. So they wanted to portray him as a, as a manager who's with you, always walking, talking and stuff, not somebody who just sits in the office cabin, you know, so very subtle messages. And so we did the entire storyboarding. Of course, we understood from them. And then the same thing has been replicated multiple times for a lot of people for induction program, as you rightly mentioned the same, because the digital twin was already ready. And we have the tech where avatars of every employee can be created, you know, in seconds, you know, with like, you just take the face cam and your avatar is ready. And so pretty much every single employee of the company can actually be an avatar. And the tech allows millions of people also to come together, you know, on the same platform, just like your fortnight or PUBG kind of thing, you know, game analogies are also available because they are multiplayer by default in nature. So they can be on the same platform and at the same time, some of the companies want this to be very solo experience where they need the leadership and leadership is either powered by AI, you know, again, we have another tech which imitates the voice modulation and the, you know, the accent and everything from the leaders directly. So they don't need to be there. It can be powered with a lot of question and answer kind of thing, which the, you know, the promoters can talk about, or if the leaders can actually join in directly and dial in and be part of the discussion, they can very much do that. So we did the similar kind of thing was with Volvo also very recently, where the managing director of Volvo was directly talking to everybody and answering every single question about their EV, which was, which is recently launched. So in a way, it's a lot of tech play. It's not just like art and craft of digital winning the place and stuff. There's a lot of tech, which allows people to, you know, have their avatars, their imitations, their voices, their modulations, their gestures, including hand gestures and all, creating the world also, customizing the world experience. It's again, it's not just a kind of a walkthrough where you go. You experience things, some of the things what, you know, I don't know if Shilpam had already spoken about the thing, what we are doing with Wells Fargo. We are fixing, you know, the offer letter and the employment, the time in between. So how to engage, involve and gamify, you know, that entire two to three months. months of notice period time when they are coming out of the previous company and joining Wells Fargo you know and the having real world physical world incentives attached to that is another layer which we have. So when you are talking about entity making them understand the new places new this thing so this entire experience can be you know a kind of a gamified something again what we did for a state the entire state of an eastern state in India where we brought in all their tourism properties in our metaverse and people had to go on an expedition from one place to the other only when you finish the first one you go to the next one but again there are a lot of you know again underlying tech which simplifies things if you fail to go to the next level but it's always interesting to understand where you are why you are here what is the core purpose of being here similarly like you know why why entity data is like you know why need to be here what is the you know what is the inspirational story behind it just as a matter of fact back in 2003-2004 I worked with entity Docomo back then and for rolling out a project in Belgium you know it was a slot game machine running on the entity Docomo data pipe you know which I was part of so I understood I spoke with the Japan team back then at length you know it's been 20 years two decades now so so this is what it is the party night is the core platform at this moment we have our own user base they come to the platform just like Roblox kind of thing but of course we white label and we give it to like of course entity will be needing its own metaverse rather than being on party night kind of thing similarly we did for the the eastern state where we created built world for them but if you talk about our metaverse and the popularity of that so we have about 95 million people on our platform who are sitting and about 7 million people come every day and they even though there is no game right now but there are a lot of interesting stuff what people come and play and then they engage it's a we consider this more like you know a moving talking breathing Facebook Instagram you know a tinder LinkedIn kind of thing you know where people hang out and meet each other and you know do a lot of things so yeah not sure if I missed out anything or if you have any questions Shilpam can definitely chip in and you know you know add something if I missed out. Before I forget, Rajat once again Shilpam, can you please send me that whatever you have on the Bell Sparkle thing of the offer to onboarding. Yeah, yeah, yeah sure. Because that's of interest for me on a side note before I forget. So we have got, we've got your capability deck. Rene and Paula have you seen that? I attached it to this meeting as well. I just want to double check you've both seen that and we so we've had a look at some of the examples of what you've done. I guess what would be really useful for us to see and Akhilesh you mentioned that there were some YouTube videos as well on some of the projects that you've done. I guess what would be useful is to see something that I guess is very similar to our brief. So Rajat and Shilpam, Rene can send you the brief that we have that we have been using for the other organisation as well. And if you if you could take a look at that what will be important for us is to answer a couple of key questions. A, can you meet the brief? It certainly sounds from what you've shown us so far that you can. B, we'd like to understand obviously whether from a timeline perspective we can do what we need to do by by the middle to end of March. And then the the ongoing kind of how do we then switch it over into some kind of onboarding onboarding platform and Akhilesh you might have some other needs beyond that. The third thing that's really important for us is how the platform would work within our landscape obviously within our tech landscape and we can connect you with our with our INT teams to to have a look at that. It does need to be as you would imagine and I don't need to tell you this I guess a very seamless experience for our employees both on the desktop or whatever it is that we're doing. So the tech side of it is quite critical and the security that goes with that. And then the other big thing of course is the price tag and what we're what we're thinking of is that we might need a sort of a can you give us a here's sort of like the basics here is a little bit more fancy and here is like the Rolls Royce, you know, that we can kind of, we look at what budget we might need to try and get to put towards this would be quite helpful to see as well. So that's probably where we need to go next. I'm just going to pause and ask Renee and Paula to jump in on any very specific questions that you have because you've also been in the other conversations. Renee? Sure, thank you. Thank you, Diana, and thank you for that great great overview and description and I think it's what Diana has mentioned, this is the first time, you know, our employees are going to be coming together for the first time, it's going to be the first type, you know, of impression they get of who we, you know, aspire to be as a company and that user experience is really really important. So we'd definitely like to see, you know, more examples of what the visuals look like for some of the different worlds that you've created or Metaverse's experiences that you've created. So I'm not exactly sure that the Roblox look and feel is like the vibe, for lack of a better word, that we're going for for this particular, you know, audience and then I'd like to kind of understand what the experience would be like if we had, you know, 10,000 concurrent users on it at a given time, you know, especially when you look at, you know, you look at companies like Fortnite or, you know, they can only really have 100 players in a single server, on a single floor, on a single machine at a time, right? So for the best experience of employees, you know, what type of world are you proposing, I suppose, we would go for? You know, given that there's going to be over 140,000 or close to 150,000 people over the course of 24 to 48 hours. No, absolutely, very very nice questions. Thanks much. So starting with the realism and everything, so yes, we always go for either semi-realistic or absolutely realistic, you know, visual fidelity. Roblox is not something what, you know, Roblox, we talk about Roblox and when we are talking about how people can come and build their own spaces also or how we can cater to, you know, millions and millions of people, but we don't talk about Roblox when we talk about visual fidelity. So we're not into the blocky world kind of thing. We have gone absolutely, absolutely one and when we are working with BMW and Volvo and last year we worked with Dodge also. We had like, you know, and again, it's a choice what people make, like when you're talking about Microsoft, it's a digital twin, but at the same time, digital twin which works on Nokia Lumia phone, right, which is a dated, gone, you know, this thing, so you need to adjust to the graphics fidelity, but we still remain in the category of semi-realistic, but we have gone absolutely 100% pixel by pixel realistic for a lot of brands we have worked with, you know, especially, you know, Van Heusen, Levis, apparel brands and automobile cars because for them attention to detail is something which is of paramount interest. At the same time, we are working with the Bangalore Airport, so the entire 2096 acre of the land is coming as a digital twin on our platform and we are working with Atkins for the same. So here again, it's an absolutely, you know, it's a digital twin, so it's a twin, you know, it's absolutely realistic. Point number two, the hundred people on the fortnight server is not the issue of the networking or the scalability of the network, it's the issue of how much graphics or the polygons your graphics card can actually handle, you know, so there is a challenge and that challenge, even if 140,000 people are coming in, they can all join in together. Concurrently, 140,000 is absolutely, we have, you know, like on our platform we had 20 million concurrent users also, you know, and then we recently sent the data to Guinness record also because that's the largest attended, you know, concert which we hosted. But in one single room, we call it room because these are virtual rooms, you know, and because of the challenges with the graphics power of the computers and the mobile devices, you have to restrict within 100 to 150 people only. So beyond that is definitely next to impossible at this moment, given the graphical power of, you know, the devices, what we have today. However, certain people who are very important in the overall scheme of thing, coming back to my Volvo launch, which we did for XC400 Volvo. So they're the CEO, the chief design officer and the run DMC, they are the band. They all had presence available for all 140,000 people. They could interact with all, like not 140,000 here, in this case, 730,000 people. They had access to all the 730,000 people. They could speak with each one of them if they wanted to. And so we call it God's voice, you know? So they are audible to each and every person, no matter which room, what room they are in, but you cannot go beyond a certain limit. So we have to cap it out depending on the fidelity again, on the kind of, you know, and it's not an issue of network at all here. So the thing is that we cap it out depending on the kind of visual fidelity we are going for the environment. And at the same time, the number of avatars, you know, and the fidelity of the avatars also. If we have some repetitive avatars, what people can actually come and create, I don't know if I've sent those videos to you, where we have our own avatar creation tool, which does not match you necessarily, because it does not take your photograph. It's just a tool you use within our platform to create. That's highly scalable largely because most of the things are kind of, you know, for the graphics power, you know, standpoint, they are repetitive. So we just index them out, but not getting into the technical part of it. If you are going with individual and stuff, we have to cap it at 100 or 150 at best. We cannot by any means, we can go beyond 150 people in one room. And that's, I think that's pretty common because even if the real world scenario is there, you know, you will not be able to see too many people and you will not be able to, of course we can always create, which we have like the inner circle. Like I want to go with Akhilesh and Diana. So wherever I go, they will follow by default. So if we have the system where you can lead and they'll, so if you want to go around, you can, without touching your keyboard and stuff, wherever Rajat is going, Akhilesh and Diana will follow by default. If we want to go and we still want to be independent, we can all join in the same room. We ensure that you all go in the same room in that 100 people log and you move around wherever you want to move around. So can I just ask a follow up question? Does what you're describing, I guess, assume that everybody has their own avatar and the opportunity to build their own avatar or is there a way for them to kind of navigate through the rooms, through the events without an avatar to kind of decrease that computing power need, maybe reduce the number of, or increase rather, the number of people that would be permissible in each room? So without avatars, you're saying? Yeah, basically. Oh, that's absolutely no issue at all. So similar thing, what has been done with the state, the entire state recently, we did without avatars and we hosted about 600,000 people in three days. Communication is little non-metaversal in that case, but it worked for them, that's what they wanted. I was thinking about that. Non-avatar means non-traceability for me in my head. It is, it is. How do we track who's asking what, who's saying what and things like that. So avatar actually registers that Diana is there, right? A non-avatar is we don't know who's there and they're asking questions or things like that. Basically, I'm coming from my own understanding of the ethical metaverse issues that are coming up now. Yeah, yeah. Exactly on metaverse. Yeah, and I think, I have very limited experience with this and we did play around in Microsoft's metaverse when we were in Singapore. Do you remember Rene and Akhilesh? So we had a little bit of, and I've not had any personal, huge amount of experience with this. So I guess, in my head, I'm seeing two kind of needs here. The one need is to. allow our people to be able to go in. I'm just going to describe this in my layman's terms, right? So people are coming in to this metaverse. Maybe they're coming in through our new corporate video, and then that's the first thing they watch. And then they go into our world where they can go into, let's say, five different rooms. One room they're going into, they get a sense of our clients and who our clients are and client stories and all that, what are we doing for clients. Then they go into another room where they maybe are in the Asia-Pacific room and they can hear the CEO of Asia-Pacific talking about all the great things we're doing in APAC and what the team looks like there. And then maybe they're going into a room where our portfolio, what we sell, what we do, you know, comes to life. Maybe they're going into another room that is very people-focused, and maybe there's another one that's very sustainability-focused. We're building, Renee and the team are building kind of the what is all the content we'd like people to see and engage with initially. So that's one part of it is who is this new organization, what do you look like, walks through our new world. Then there's the other part of it, which is the more proper, I guess, connecting with colleagues, talking to colleagues, a bit of gamification, which is kind of almost, I know they're not two necessarily separate things, but I guess we need more of the former supplemented with some of the latter, where you might create an avatar, where you might want to start talking to your colleagues in another part of the organization. But I think for the starting point, we probably need more of the, we're delivering an event that we will run over like a two- or three-day period. We might want to deliver it or communicate it and introduce it in such a way that we're doing a kind of a follow the sun over the 24 hours. We've got Australia online, then we've got APAC online, then we've got the Middle East, and so on and so on. So people are coming into it in their regions and in their parts of the business at different times, and that runs for three days. Then maybe there's some ongoing interaction, avatar, more proper metaverse stuff, and then there's also an onboarding module. So I think that's probably how I'm seeing it, if I just described it from my perspective. So your phase one, I think, is very safe bet for the time you have and where we can introduce you to the facility, to the organization in general, the leadership, and their videos, their avatar, their a lot of policies and other things in a much more experiential way than stuff, because I don't think inter-avatar communication is of any significance in this particular phase. You can still ask questions, and those can be registered because you'll probably be entering using your employee ID. I don't know what...so when we work with one of the largest private sector bank in India, ICICI Bank, we did more than 80 engagements with them, so we actually work with the API, what they provided for all the employee tracking and everything. So if that is your ID, we'll get to know who's coming in, who's asking what question. Question can still be voice-based or chat-based without any kind of avatar. That's going to be largely a solo experience, but still one-on-one experience with the leadership. But probably your colleagues will not be there, so that way you are kind of pretty safe in terms of scalability also. You can still chat with the leadership, you can still talk, and you can still understand the organization and the leadership and the vision and the services. But then the phase two is where your colleagues will come and you will talk to your people of all across the continents and other things and stuff like that. But tracking and other things can definitely be solved, but again, we can always think through and come up with more solutions and more options and possibilities there. Okay, that's great. How would it work with people interacting with other forms of content? So rather than interacting live with, say, leaders, if we were thinking that we would have other forms of content, so videos or different things, how would that kind of interaction work? in the world itself. So you're gonna keep it more awful, kind of like time-based, real-time kind of solutions where leader is slotted to speak let's say CEO, you know, is slotted to speak at 1.30 and his talk will be there till 2.15 or 2.30 or they can come and initiate whenever they want and they want to understand. So both the things are possible to be this thing. In fact, if there are certain talks and certain things where everybody needs to be present we can probably force people to join in. Like we can always, like that's what we have. We have a, you know, countdown kind of thing that you are getting teleported to that place. So you finish whatever else you are doing within that world and you can directly get teleported to whenever CEO is speaking. So everybody goes to the same room where the CEO is speaking. But if it is not real-time and you have a lot of videos and a lot of other information booklets or, you know, posters or stuff like that, those can always be, you know, like it will be just be a click or, you know, kind of things. Whatever interaction mechanism and whatever devices we are going on, you know, can be, you know, decided based upon that. Did I answer your question, Paula? Yes, thank you. I love the idea that we can kind of, if we were running like a two-day event, that you can go in and interact with all the content but then everyone gets teleported to the CEO all-hands room where, you know, we have a CEO, you know, presentation at 8 o'clock in the morning, 12 o'clock at midday and 5 o'clock in the afternoon. So every time zone kind of gets teleported there to hear him speak. I mean, it could even become like a sort of an all-hands type of platform, couldn't it? We could use it for our all-hands events. Absolutely. In April and beyond. Diana, basically, in Jetpack, what was built was a lightweight of a Metaverse but more like a second life, not a Metaverse. Yes. More like a second life. It was built with some augmentation, 3D augmentation and things like that. We used to do our global town halls and all-hands, even some of the overtime virtual events on that one. Yes. Jetpack was a big one. Lightweight. I guess the only other thought I have, Rajat and Shilpam, is that we're a tech company, right? So we want to use tech, we showcase tech. We have a CEO who's very innovative, who's very forward-thinking, who's always pushing us to do more and do more exciting, interesting stuff. So we've got the right culture in the organisation, I think, but we also have a lot of consultants and we also have a lot of more cerebral heads in the organisation. And I guess, we have a very big demographic difference between, and I don't actually remember what our figures are demographic-wise and I don't know what they are in the new organisation. But we happen to appeal to a very large audience. And I guess I'm always concerned that something veers towards the cheesy, gamey, slightly too, not serious enough, but a bit too gamey. Gamification-wise, if you know what I mean. Which is great in some cultures, but not so good in other cultures. Sure. You will be familiar with how the Germans interact, how the Brits interact, how the Americans interact versus how the Indians interact. So I think when we think about all of our fabulous world of however many cultures we have, how do we make sure that it appeals to all of them and doesn't become too sort of I guess looking just like something fun to do, which most people are too busy to have a bit of fun to do. That was the other thought going through my mind. Very interesting question, but I probably deal with this question pretty much every week, if not every day. Some of the companies I work with, unfortunately or fortunately, I don't know, but there's a very big financial services company in the world, about $13 billion plus. Probably the youngest employee of that company is 60 years old. We are making them play. On our platform. All the decision makers are like 60 and above. Initially, it was quite a challenge for us to make them understand why and how, but I think over the period of time, we proved and we are in 15th engagement with them now. Similarly with some of the other companies where even like if you look at the Microsoft or the Bangalore airport and stuff, it's not always the gamey population which is consuming it. Very recently our biggest success story and because of which we trended across the entire country as number one in all the segments possible was because there's a minister who's like roughly around 68 or 70 year old. He was literally interacting with our system and absolutely as if it's a very organic field to that. So I think we, over the period of time, we lost the skin of being the gamers first and became more of metaverse oriented where when we are talking about digital twin, we are not just talking about gamified twin. We are talking about absolutely what we'll do in the physical world. You're gonna do it in this digital world and that is the genesis and that is the thesis we are going after. And that's actually working for us because once you are in the system and you are interacting with it, largely you will feel that you are in your office or you're visiting the place. It's just gonna be little more personal, little more experiential and little more fun maybe. But still, you're gonna love being there kind of. So people are spending, at an average at this moment, our average screen time within our per session in our metaverse is about 13 minutes, which is way higher than YouTube. So per user, if you're talking about 95 million people on our platform, per session, they spend over 13 minutes on the platform, which is kind of by Netflix standard or by YouTube standard is a staggering number. So the reason why there is, and not everybody is coming there to literally play a game or some people just hang out, some people are running courses, some people are attending classes, as complicated as studying medicines and stuff like that. So I guess I think I'm confident that we can make it less gamey and more experiential for people. Thank you. Did you say, sorry, did you say 13, one, three, or three hour minutes? No, no, one, three, I said. 30 is going to be, like, I can retire if I actually have 30. I know, I just wondered, I just wanted to make sure I heard correctly. No, no, no, that's a tall claim. Just a few minutes left, so any last half minute questions? I think we all were so engaged in our conversations that we did not let poor Shilpum speak at all. No, I tried to wake her up, she did not. No further conversations. No, that's good, and I know the right person is speaking and the right questions are being answered, so that's why I want the silent mode, it's fine. Okay, thank you. So in closing, if there are no other last quick questions from anyone, Rajat, we will send over our brief, so you can just have a look at what we're trying to do here first, firstly, and then if you need to reconnect with us for any questions, please let Renee know, and as quickly as possible, it would be really good to get a sense of, can it be done, what would the price tags be, and then we can obviously, we can look at that and get cracking on, we're already doing the background work on what content we want in it and how it might all work, and getting ready for the additional content we might need to create, or videos we might need to shoot, and so on, so we're doing that work in the background as well, but does that sound like a good next step? Absolutely, and I have a 50% answer already, yes, it can be done, you know, the next 50% I'll answer later, once I get your brief. Okay, excellent, thank you again, everyone, really really do appreciate your time, and good to meet you both, and Shilpa, next time we'll hopefully see you, and your camera will be active as well. Yeah. Oh yes, yes, I will ensure that, glad to connect with all of you, Paula, Rene, Tida, and Akhilesh, Akhilesh again, yes, so, yes, we look forward to the brief, I think, as you said, Rene would be sharing, right? Yes. Yeah, we look forward to the brief and then we'll get back with the complete tiered of pricing. That's what, which I understood, like what is the basics that we need to cover up and what are the add-ons that will help you make your rolls rise, right? Yes. Yes, exactly. Brilliant. Thank you again so much. Really good to meet you and have a good rest of the day. Yeah. Fantastic meeting you, all of you. Like, it was great. Great questions. Yeah. I loved it. Thanks. Thanks again. Bye-bye. Bye. "
